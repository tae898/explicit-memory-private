This repo hosts a package `humemai`, a human-like memory systems that are modeled with
knowledge knoweldge graphs (KGs). At the moment they are nothing but a Python list of
RDF quadruples, but soon it'll be a better object type so that they can be compatible
with graph databases, e.g., RDFLib, GraphDB, Neo4j, etc. Making it compatible with
RDFLib is top priority and it'll come with v2. There have been both [academic
papers](#list-of-academic-papers-that-use-humemai) and
[applications](#list-of-applications-that-use-humemai) that have used this package.
